# Single Page Application (leiningen template)

Leiningen template for [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) web apps.


## "Just fucking ship it"

> "Don't have a just idea, just have an idea"

### Here's the workflow.

1. Write code; iterate quickly with figwheel
```
lein figwheel dev
```
Browse to http://localhost:3449.

2. Build code
```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```

3. Commit code
```
git add resources
git commit -m
```

4. Ship it
```
git subtree push --prefix resources/public/ origin gh-pages
```

Your app is now live at `http://*your-gh-username*.github.io/*repository-name*`
